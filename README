These are some code examples to support the MIDI Basics column in the TK 
2012 issue of Popular Science.  They're simple, but they should be enough
to get you going with MIDI and an Arduino.

If you make some well commented examples of your own that you'd like to 
include here, please fork the repository and issue a pull request.  If 
possible, please use the same circuit or one based upon the demo circuit
used here so that these examples can all run on the same hardware.

That hardware is defined in ./hardware

References for further reading are listed in ./further_reading.txt 

You can build an interface circuit based on this schematic:

If you are building the MIDI IN side with a 6N138 Optoisolator instead
of the PC-900, replace the MIDI IN part of the above with this:

Or just pick up a MIDI Breakout Board or MIDI Shield from Sparkfun, both
of which will stack directly on your Arduino:

The Examples: 

Chordinator:

 * This code will read Note On and Note Off messages on Channel 1
 * arriving at the MIDI IN port and play a Chord built on each of 
 * those notes to the MIDI OUT port.  Connect the MIDI OUT of your
 * keyboard to the MIDI IN of the Arduino and the MIDI OUT of the
 * Arduino to the MIDI IN of the keyboard.  


Control Change:

 * This code will send Control Change (or PitchBend, or 
 * Aftertouch, etc...) messages based on the position of the 
 * potentiometer every time it's position changes.  This is just 
 * a simple demo designed to get you up and running with MIDI. 


Play Notes:

 * This code will send Note On and Note Off messages on Channel 1
 * based on the position of the potentiometer when the button is
 * pressed.  This is just a simple demo designed to get you up and 
 * running with MIDI.


Read Notes:

 * This code will read Note On and Note Off messages on Channel 1
 * arriving at the MIDI IN port.  This is just a simple demo designed 
 * to get you up and running with MIDI.
